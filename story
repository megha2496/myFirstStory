A long, long time ago, there lived a hare in the forest who always boasted of his running speed. 
He would often tease the tortoise for being the slowest animal around. 
One fine day, he dared the tortoise to a race in order to exhibit his skills in front of other animals in the forest. 
Fed up with the hareâ€™s bragging, the tortoise finally accepted the challenge and decided to compete him in a race.
